Initialization: path= [], all_paths= []
insert in all_paths an element of the form [A] â€“starting
while all_paths is not empty
  pop an element x out of all_paths// e.g.  x=[A,B,C] 
                                   // x is the path array/vector
  if the last node of x is B return x
  update all_pathswith all possibilities for x
    (for each neighbor N of the last node of x,
    add to all_pathsa path with x, extended with N
    i.e, if x = [A,B,C] then add [A,B,C,N] to all_paths)
end-while
if all_ paths isempty then return no-solution
